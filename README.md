For this app I designed a memory game with live high score updates where players had to remember shuffled cards of soccer players. This app taught me more about the MVC pattern while also letting me practice utilizing React hooks to updates states and allow for live updates. I was also able to practice test driven development using unit tests through Jest to ensure scores were being kept correctly. I utilized React, JS, HTML, and CSS in this project.
